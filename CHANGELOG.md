### v1.0 - We made it! üéâ
  - When upgrading from 0.9 to the current version things might not work as expected:
    - ‚ö† **PLEASE MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR PROJECT BEFORE UPGRADING** ‚ö†
    - Glossary variables will be lost
    - Glossary related events will not be loaded (`If condition Event` and `Set Value Event`)
    - The theme you made in the 0.9 theme editor will be lost. You will have to remake it.

  - New layout:
    - All editors in the same screen. Say goodbye to tabs!
    - You can now rename resources by double clicking them
    - New Settings panel for advanced properties
      - Settings:
        - Re-added the auto color for character names in text messages
        - Removing empty Text Event from timelines
        - New lines to create new Text Event messages
        - Propagation of input to the rest of the Tree
  - Character Editor:
    - Set the scale of your character's portrait
    - Add offset to the portrait
  - Timeline Editor:
    - New `Theme event` to change the theme in the middle of a timeline
    - New `Background Music Event` to play music in your dialog. Music can crossfade when changing track and fade in/out when starting/stopping.
    - Re-enabled the `Scene Event`
    - Allow making basic calculations such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` in `Set value events`.
  - Theme Editor:
    - You can now add multiple themes.
    - Moved the preview button to the left side so it is never hidden by default in small screens.
    - New section to edit how the character names are displayed.
    - New properties:
      - `Box size` set the width and height of the dialogue box in pixels
      - `Alignment` you can now align the text displayed (Left, Center, Right)
      - `Bottom Gap` The distance between the bottom of the screen and the start of the dialog box.
      - `Next animation` Set an animation for the "Next Dialog Indicator"
  - Glossary was renamed to Definitions. I feel like the word `Definitions` cover both "variables" and "lore" a bit better.
  - Definitions:
    - Dynamic types! All variables are just dynamic, so they can be ints, floats or strings.
    - The name of a character can be set to be a definition.
    - You can display definition values in a Text Event by doing: `[definition name here]`.
  - Fixed many resource issues with exported games
  - New icons all around.
  - Added some basic light theme support. This is not finished, but it is on a much better state than before.
  - The events now emit signals. Thank you [Jesse Lieberg](https://github.com/GammaGames) for your first contribution!
  - Special thanks to [Arnaud Vergnet](https://github.com/arnaudvergnet) for all your work in improving Definitions, conditional events and many more! üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### v0.9 - House keeping
  - Video: https://youtu.be/pL0RWVmlM6g
  - Moved `Dialog.tscn` to the root of the addon so it is easier to find.
  - Added a link to the documentation from the editor
  - Refactored a lot of the code and continued splitting the main plugin code into smaller pieces.
  - Rewrote most of the saving and branching systems.
  - New tool: Glossary Editor
    - You are now able to write extra lore for any word and Dialogic will create a hover card with that extra information.
    - You can create `strings` and `number` variables.
    - You can access to those variables from the `Dialogic` Class: `Dialogic.get_var('variable_name')`
  - In game:
    - Portraits changes are reflected in-game.
    - Many small improvements.
  - Theme Editor:
    - New default asset: Glossary Font
    - Added new options to customize the glossary popup
  - Timeline Editor:
    - Added categories for the events.
    - Color coded some of the events in the same category to avoid having a distracting rainbow in the timelines.
    - Conditional event working, but only with "equal to". More conditions coming later.
    - Renamed the `End Branch` file names to match the name of the event. This will break the conditionals you have, but this is the time for making breaking changes. Sorry!
    - New `Set Value` event. Change the current value of a glossary variable inside a timeline. This will reset when you close the game, so a saving system will have to be added on the next version.
    - New `Emit Signal` event. This event will make the Dialog node emit a signal called `dialogic_signal`. You can connect this in a moment of your timeline with other scripts.
    - New `Change Scene` event. You can change the current Scene to whatever `.tscn` you pick. This will happen instantly, but in the future I'll add some transition effects so it is not that abrupt.
    - New `Wait Seconds` event. This will hide the dialog and wait X seconds until continuing with the rest of the timeline. 
    - Created independent Character and Portrait picker for reusing in event nodes.
    - Portrait picker added to `Text Events` and `Character Join` events.
    - `Text Events` text editor vertical size grows witch each line added.
    - `Text Events` now properly create a new message for each line inside the text editor.
    - `Text Events` Line count are now displayed next to the preview text when folded.
    - Re-adding the `End Branch` event just in case you removed the end and you want to add it again in the timeline.
    - Renamed the `Copy Timeline ID` right click menu option to `Copy Timeline Name` since you now have to use that to set the current timeline from code instead of the ID.
    - Fixed several bugs that corrupted saved files
    - Thanks to [mindtonix](https://github.com/mindtonix) and [Crystalwarrior](https://github.com/Crystalwarrior) for your first contribution on the choice buttons 
  - New `Dialogic` class. With this new class you can add dialogs from code easily:
    ```
    var new_dialog = Dialogic.start('Your Timeline Name Here')
    add_child(new_dialog)
    ```
    To connect signals you can also do:

    ```swift
    func _ready():
        var new_dialog = Dialogic.start('Your Timeline Name Here')
        add_child(new_dialog)
        new_dialog.connect("dialogic_signal", self, 'signal_from_dialogic')

    func signal_from_dialogic(value):
        print(value)
    ```
