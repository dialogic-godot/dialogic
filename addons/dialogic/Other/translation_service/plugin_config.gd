# This does literally nothing, for now
# This is a modified version of TranslationService plugin
# made exclusively to work with Dialogic
# To use the original plugin, please refer to: 
# https://github.com/AnidemDex/Godot-TranslationService
#
# What's different?
# - There's no TS shortcut
# - TranslationService doesn't populate the editor
# - Every translation should be done trough 
#   DialogicTranslator.translate instead TranslatorService.translate

# This file can be safely removed
