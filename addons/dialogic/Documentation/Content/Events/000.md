# Text Event

The text event is one of the most important ones since this will be containing most of your text.

## The header

You have up to tree different types of options here:
- **Character** - This is who will be saying the text written inside the text editor. 
- **Portrait** - If you picked a **Character** the different portraits will show up here. If that **Character** doesn't have any special portraits the default one will be used. If you pick the `(Don't change)` option, it will continue using the previous text event portrait set. If you pick the `[Definition]` option, a new picker will show up.
- **Definition** - You can select any of your **Definitions** and it will try to match that string with available portraits. This can be used to dynamically show different portraits depending of previous player input.

## The Text Editor

Inside the text editor you have special features that might not be obvious to everyone:

- Each line will create a new text message. This will help you to make longer monologues without having to add a new **Text Event** for each message. If you want to disable this, you can do so in the Dialogic settings pannel: `Settings -> Dialog -> New lines will create extra messages`.

- When writing a **Character** name, Dialogic will automatically color the text of that **Character**

- `[br]` This will add a line break in the position of the tag

- `[nw] / [nw=2] / [nw=v]` The *no wait* command will tell Dialogic to automatically continue with the next event without any user input. The default time for skipping to the next text is 2 seconds (after all characters are displayed), but you can change how many seconds by setting a number to it (like `[nw=5]` for 5 seconds). You can use [nw=v] to continue after the audio (if any is used) finished.

- `[speed=X]` You can use the *speed* tag to change the speed during a text event. Placed at the beginning of the event it will affect the whole text, but each following speed command will overwrite the previous. Higher numbers result in a slower and lower ones in a fast speed. If you want the text to be instant for one message you can do `[speed=0]` and it will show up automatically. 
After the event containing the *speed* tag is over, it will go back to whatever value you have set on the current theme. 

- `[definition]` If you have a **Definition** and you want to display its value on inside your text you can use the `[` and `]` characters and the name of your **Definition** to print it. Let's say we have a **Definition** called `Money` with the value of `5`. we can write: `You have [Money] left` and Dialogic will replace the `[Money]` tag with the value `You have 5 left`.

- `[word1,word2,word3]` You can write a list of words like this: `[word1,word2,word3]` and the text event will pick a random word from the list. If the word is a Dialogic variable name and it gets picked it will show the value of that variable.

- `[signal=argument]` will emit the dialogic signal with the given argument (as a string) when this place is reached.

- `[pause=1]` will stop displaying new characters for 1 second and then continue.

- `[play=click.wav]` will play an audio file with the given name. These files have to be located in `"res://dialogic/sounds/"`.

- Beside these dialogic specific options, there are the default `BBCode` options that every `RichTextLabel` has like [b]bold[/b] or [i]italic[/i] text, [color=red]colored text[/color] and [wave]using effects[/wave]!
