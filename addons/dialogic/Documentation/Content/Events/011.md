# Choice Event

The `Choice Event` marks the start of a choice branch in a [question](./010.md).

## How it works
Choice Events only work if they are placed inside a question. Then you can place all kinds of events below that choice. These events (which will be indented) will be executed when the choice is selected.

## Adding a condition
By checking the `Has condition` check box, you can add a condition to the choice. This means the player will only see that choice if the condition is true.
The condition is made up of three parts: The `Value Definition` that will be compared, the `type of comparison` and the `value` that it will be compared to.
