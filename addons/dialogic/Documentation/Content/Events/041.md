# Change Scene

The `Change Scene` event will stop the current scene and load the selected one. This means the dialogue will be stopped too. 

Be careful when using this while you your tree is set to paused! Consider adding an [Emit Signal event](./040.md) before and resume the tree with `get_tree().paused = false`.
