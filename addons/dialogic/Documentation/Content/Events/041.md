# Change Scene

The `Change Scene` event will stop the current scene and load the selected one. This means the dialog will be stopped too. 

Be carefull when using this while you your tree is set to paused! Consider adding an [Emit Signal event](./040.md) before and unpausing the tree with `get_tree().paused = false`.
