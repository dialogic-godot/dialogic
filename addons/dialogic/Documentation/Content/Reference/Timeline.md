# Timeline Editor

The `timeline editor` is one of the central parts of Dialogic, allowing you create your dialogue tree using the Events system.

This editor consists of two parts: the main area, and the event bar on the side. The event bar allows you to add events to the main area, and the main area is where you write your text and arrange the events to create your timeline tree.

## Building a timeline
Begin by pressing an event button or dragging it onto the main area in a desired location.

Once in the timeline tree, you can move events by dragging and dropping them.


## Shortcuts
By holding CTRL, you can select multiple events by clicking on them. By holding SHIFT, you can select a range of events from the one initially selected to the one you click on.

The editor supports the following short-cuts: 
`
CRTL+C 					copy selected events
CRTL+P 					paste selected events 
CRTL+X 					cut selected events
DEL						delete selected events
DOWN/UP					select the next/previous event
ALT+UP/DOWN				move the selected event up or down (only works with one event)
CRTL+A					 select all events
CRTL+SHIFT+A 			  deselect all events
CRTL+Z					 undo the last event action
CRTL+Y or CRTL+SHIFT+Z 	redo the last undone action

CRTL+T 					add a new Text event
`
