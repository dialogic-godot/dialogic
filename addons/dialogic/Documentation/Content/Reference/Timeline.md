# Timeline Editor

The `timeline editor` is one of the central parts of Dialogic: here you can create your story using the Events.

This editor consists of two parts, the main area and the event bar on the side, where you can find all events.

## Building a timeline
You can press one of the event buttons to add the event below the selected one, or you can drag and drop them to where you want.

You move events by clicking and dragging them. 


## Shortcuts
Select multiple events by holding CRTL. Range select with SHIFT.

The editor supports the following short-cuts: 
`
CRTL+C 					copy selected events
CRTL+P 					paste selected events 
CRTL+X 					cut selected events
DEL						delete selected events
DOWN/UP					select the next/previous event
ALT+UP/DOWN				move the selected event up or down (only works with one event)
CRTL+A					 select all events
CRTL+SHIFT+A 			  deselect all events
CRTL+Z					 undo the last event action
CRTL+Y or CRTL+SHIFT+Z 	redo the last undone action
