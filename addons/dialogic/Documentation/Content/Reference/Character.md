# Character Editor

The `Character Editor` is used to set up the characters of your story. Here you can learn more about the editor's settings.

## Names
### Name
The first setting is the character's name. This is the name that you will see in all the menus, and by default it's the one displayed when the character is speaking.

### Display Name
You can change what name is shown when the character speaks by enabeling and setting the `Display Name`.

### Nicknames
By default, all occurrences of the character's name in text are colored in the character's color.
*This can be disabled in settings.*
By using the `Nicknames` feature, you can add additional names that will also be colored. Just enable the Nicknames box and add all Names that should be colored as a comma- (`,`)-seperated list.

## Color
Here you can set the character's color. This is the color that the character's name will be colored in texts, if that option hasn't been disabled.
You can also set this color to be used in themes for the `Name Label`. 
*Can be found as 'Use character color' in the Name Label section*

## Description
This area is for you to take notes. It has no effect on your game.

## Portraits / Expressions
This section is one of the most important, as it allows you to load all the images of your character. We highly recommend that you give each one a useful name, as it will make it easier to use them!
You can also import a whole folder of images with the **`Import images from folder`** button.

## Preview
On the right, you can see a preview of the currently selected portrait.

## IMPORTANT nearly hidden settings
Below the preview, there are three easy to miss but very useful settings:

### Scale
Changing this allows you to scale the portraits down. If your portraits are far too big in the game, adjust this setting until they look right.

### Offset
Sets an offset that will adjust the position of your character in two dimensions, depending on the base location selected in the Timeline.

### Mirror portraits
This will mirror all of the portraits. You can then use the mirror option of the `Character Join Event`.
