# Character Editor

The `Character Editor` is used to set up the characters of your story. Here you can learn more about the editor's settings.

### Color and Name Name
The first settings are the character's name and the color used for it. This is the name that you will see in all the menus, and by default it's the one displayed when the character is speaking.

### Display Name
You can change what name is shown in game when the character speaks by enabeling and setting the `Display Name`.

### Nicknames
By default, all occurrences of the character's name in text are colored in the character's color.
*This can be disabled in settings.*
By using the `Nicknames` feature, you can add additional names that will also be colored. Just enable the Nicknames box and add all Names that should be colored as a comma- (`,`)-seperated list.

### Description
This area is for you to take notes. It has no effect on your game.

### Theme
This allows to use a different theme whenever the character speaks. The game will change back to the previous one once a different character speaks.


## Portraits / Expressions
This section is one of the most important, as it allows you to load all the images of your character. We highly recommend that you give each one a useful name, as it will make it easier to use them!
You can also import a whole folder of images with the **`Import folder`** button.

### Scale
Changing this allows you to scale the portraits down. If your portraits are far too big in the game, adjust this setting until they look right.

### Offset
Sets an offset that will adjust the position of your character in two dimensions, depending on the base location selected in the timeline.

### Mirror portraits
This will mirror all of the portraits. You can use the mirror option of the `Character Event` if you just want to mirror it sometimes.


## Preview
On the right, you can see a preview of the currently selected portrait. 

You can change between "Full View" which will fit the portrait image to the size of the preview container. Use "Actual Size" to see the image in the size it will have in the game.
