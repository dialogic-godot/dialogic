# Changelog

## v1.3 - (WIP)
#### General Editor Stuff
- **Builtin documentation** [[Jowan-Spooner](https://github.com/Jowan-Spooner)]
    - Added a button to open the documentation from the nav bar
- The plugin has now **Editor-translation support** and some labels are translated to Chinese [[magian1127](https://github.com/magian1127)]
    - Added some initial Spanish translations
- Replaced the default `/addons/dialogic/Dialog.tscn` node with a proxy that creates a dialog using the `Dialogic.start` function instead of the raw node. This will make it easier to update from version to version since the instantiated node will not be changing a lot from version to version. This also moved and renamed the previous `/addons/dialogic/Dialog.tscn` to `/addons/dialogic/Nodes/DialogNode.tscn` and the `dialog_node.gd` is now called `DialogNode.gd` to be more in line with the rest of the project
- CanvasLayer Argument (Dialogic.start()) added to the CSharp Class
- Creating new resources will automatically start the renaming of it
- New plugin icon! It should now display at its proper scale depending on your rendering scale

#### Timeline Editor:
- A modular **Custom events** implementation [[Jowan-Spooner](https://github.com/Jowan-Spooner)]. Learn about them [here](./Events/Custom Events/CreateCustomEvents.md).
- Added a **preview image on the portrait picker**, so it is easy to know what sprite or scene you are selecting. Thanks to [EmmaH](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4y59CMiLxWQQVqVFBYLa3Q) for the idea and [Jowan-Spooner](https://github.com/Jowan-Spooner) for the implementation
- Added **Voice Line support** for Text and Question Events [[RedXGames](https://github.com/RedXGames)]. Learn how to use it [here](./Tutorials/VoiceLines.md).
    - Added option to use a certain region of the audio files [[KvaGram](https://github.com/KvaGram)]
- Partial support for **undo and redo** [[Jowan-Spooner](https://github.com/Jowan-Spooner)]
- Better **light/custom theme support** for the timeline editor [[Jowan-Spooner](https://github.com/Jowan-Spooner)]
    - Changed the Selected Event Style to only have blue borders and not change event color [[Jowan-Spooner](https://github.com/Jowan-Spooner)]
- Adding an extra space at the end of the timelines so it is easier to drag and drop new events
- After selecting a conditional, the input field of that event will be selected
- Updated UI of the AudioPickers [[Jowan-Spooner]](https://github.com/Jowan-Spooner)
- Automatically scrolling to newly created events when you click on a create event button [[Jowan-Spooner](https://github.com/Jowan-Spooner)]
- If no characters are present in the current project the character picker is hidden and a prompt was added in the Character join and Character leave events to create one [[zaknafean](https://github.com/zaknafean)]
- Copy Timeline Name will now return the full path to that timeline

#### Theme Editor:
- **Updated Audio Settings** [[Tim Krief](https://github.com/timkrief)]: 
   - you can now select audio for typing, text completed, next event, button hover and button selecting
   - Attention: Old typing audio will have to be redone!
- You can now set the **position of the buttons relative to the screen** (Top, Bottom, Center, Left, Right)
- You can now set the choice buttons to be **aligned horizontally or vertically**
- More range for dialog text speed [[zaknafean](https://github.com/zaknafean)]
- A default theme is created on new projects [[zaknafean](https://github.com/zaknafean)]

#### Ingame Behaviour
- `ATTENTION`: Rework and improvement of the **saving system**. 
    This includes some breaking changes. Learn all about the new system and how to transition [here](./Tutorials/Saving.md).
    - A **visual novel template** with a working menu is being made. You can find it [here](https://github.com/Dialogic-Godot/visual-novel-template).
- `Dialogic.start()` will now use paths for specific timelines. A fallback is in place, but specificity is preferred. For instance: `Dialogic.start('my-timeline')` will search any timeline with that name; `Dialogic.start('/chapter-1/my-timeline')` will open the timeline namde `my-timeline` inside the folder `chapter-1`.
- If the text is too big for your dialog and you see a scrolling bar, you can use the `up` and `down` keys to scroll [[Jowan-Spooner](https://github.com/Jowan-Spooner)]
- Rework of the character name coloring (using Regex now) [[Jowan-Spooner](https://github.com/Jowan-Spooner)]
    - Regex name compiler now properly escapes special characters [[zaknafean](https://github.com/zaknafean)]

#### Other Stuff:
- Renamed the plugin entry point script from `dialogic.gd` to `plugin.gd` so it better describes what that file does

## v1.0 - We made it! 🎉
  - When upgrading from 0.9 to the current version things might not work as expected:
    - ⚠ **PLEASE MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR PROJECT BEFORE UPGRADING** ⚠
    - Glossary variables will be lost
    - Glossary related events will not be loaded (`If condition Event` and `Set Value Event`)
    - The theme you made in the 0.9 theme editor will be lost. You will have to remake it.
  - Video [https://youtu.be/MeaS3zZxpbA](https://youtu.be/MeaS3zZxpbA)
  - New layout:
    - All editors in the same screen. Say goodbye to tabs!
    - You can now rename resources by double clicking them
    - New Settings panel for advanced properties
      - Settings:
        - Re-added the auto color for character names in text messages

        - New lines to create new Text Event messages
        - Propagation of input to the rest of the Tree

## v0.9 - House keeping
  - Video: [https://youtu.be/pL0RWVmlM6g](https://youtu.be/pL0RWVmlM6g)
  - Moved `Dialog.tscn` to the root of the addon so it is easier to find.
  - Added a link to the documentation from the editor
  - Refactored a lot of the code and continued splitting the main plugin code into smaller pieces.
  - Rewrote most of the saving and branching systems.
  - New tool: Glossary Editor
    - You are now able to write extra lore for any word and Dialogic will create a hover card with that extra information.
    - You can create `strings` and `number` variables.
    - You can access to those variables from the `Dialogic` Class: `Dialogic.get_var('variable_name')`
  - In game:
    - Portraits changes are reflected in-game.
    - Many small improvements.
  - Theme Editor:
    - New default asset: Glossary Font
    - Added new options to customize the glossary popup
  - Timeline Editor:
    - Added categories for the events.
    - Color coded some of the events in the same category to avoid having a distracting rainbow in the timelines.
    - Conditional event working, but only with "equal to". More conditions coming later.
    - Renamed the `End Branch` file names to match the name of the event. This will break the conditionals you have, but this is the time for making breaking changes. Sorry!
    - New `Set Value` event. Change the current value of a glossary variable inside a timeline. This will reset when you close the game, so a saving system will have to be added on the next version.
    - New `Emit Signal` event. This event will make the Dialog node emit a signal called `dialogic_signal`. You can connect this in a moment of your timeline with other scripts.
    - New `Change Scene` event. You can change the current Scene to whatever `.tscn` you pick. This will happen instantly, but in the future I'll add some transition effects so it is not that abrupt.
    - New `Wait Seconds` event. This will hide the dialog and wait X seconds until continuing with the rest of the timeline. 
    - Created independent Character and Portrait picker for reusing in event nodes.
    - Portrait picker added to `Text Events` and `Character Join` events.

    - `Text Events` now properly create a new message for each line inside the text editor.

    - Re-adding the `End Branch` event just in case you removed the end and you want to add it again in the timeline.
    - Renamed the `Copy Timeline ID` right click menu option to `Copy Timeline Name` since you now have to use that to set the current timeline from code instead of the ID.
    - Fixed several bugs that corrupted saved files
    - Thanks to [mindtonix](https://github.com/mindtonix) and [Crystalwarrior](https://github.com/Crystalwarrior) for your first contribution on the choice buttons 
  - New `Dialogic` class. With this new class you can add dialogs from code easily:
    ```
    var new_dialog = Dialogic.start('Your Timeline Name Here')
    add_child(new_dialog)
    ```
    To connect signals you can also do:

    ```swift
    func _ready():
        var new_dialog = Dialogic.start('Your Timeline Name Here')
        add_child(new_dialog)
        new_dialog.connect("dialogic_signal", self, 'signal_from_dialogic')
