# Updating to 1.4

1.4 has brought some big changes, and a few changed the behavior in a way that might break some older code of yours. 
This assumes you are upgrading from version 1.3.

Here is everything you need to do to successfully updated (as far as we know):

## 1. Make a backup of your project
- Close your project/Godot
- Make a full project backup just in case you lose some data while upgrading
- Remove the `/addons/dialogic` folder from your project 
- Paste the new Dialogic 1.4 into the addons folder
- Open your project/Godot again
- Enable the new Dialogic from the plugin menu (Project Settings/Plugins)
