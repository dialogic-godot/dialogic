# Voice Line Support

You can add audio to your text events! Here's what you have to do:

## 1. Settings
In Dialogic's `Settings` window, enable audio for Text events. 

I recommend also creating a `new audio bus` for your voice lines. 
If you do this correctly now and select it as the default bus (the next setting), you wont have to select it every time. 
Having a seperate bus allows you to control the volume and effects of the voice lines seperately from your other audio.

## 2. Adding audio to your Text events
Now when you see a Text or Question event, you should find that it has a new section called 'Audio Pickers'.
For each line (except if "New lines create extra messages" is off) you will find an Audio picker.
You can select the `audio file` you want to play while that line is shown. 

You can also change `volume`, `audiobus`, and an `audio region` (the second to begin at and the one where to end).
Leave both audio-regions at 0 to play the whole file.

Great! That's all you need to know.
