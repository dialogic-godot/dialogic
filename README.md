## Getting started

You can read a step by step guide on how to use [Dialogic here](https://github.com/coppolaemilio/dialogic/blob/dialogic-1/addons/dialogic/Documentation/Content/Tutorials/BeginnersGuideStepByStep.md)

## 📚 Documentation
You can check the documentation from inside the plugin or [here](https://github.com/coppolaemilio/dialogic/blob/dialogic-1/addons/dialogic/Documentation/Content/Welcome.md)

## Installation

To install a Dialogic, download it as a ZIP archive. All releases are listed here: [releases](https://github.com/coppolaemilio/dialogic/releases). Then extract the ZIP archive and move the `addons/` folder it contains into your project folder. Then, enable the plugin in project settings.

If you want to know more about installing plugins you can read the [Godot docs page](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/installing_plugins.html).

You can also install Dialogic using the **AssetLib** tab in the editor, but the version here will not be the latest one available since it takes some time for it to be approved.

## ⚠ IMPORTANT
There has been some people having issues exporting their games. If you are having issues you can try to add `*.cgh` and `*.json` to your export settings [(image)](https://coppolaemilio.com/images/dialogic/exporting-2.png). If it is not that, try having at least 1 theme in your project. If you still have issues, please [open an issue](https://github.com/coppolaemilio/dialogic/issues).
