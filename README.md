## Installation

To install a Dialogic, download it as a ZIP archive. All releases are listed here: [releases](https://github.com/coppolaemilio/dialogic/releases). Then extract the ZIP archive and move the `addons/` folder it contains into your project folder. Then, enable the plugin in project settings. If you see errors in the output panel, you might need to reboot the editor after enabling Dialogic for the first time.

If you want to know more about installing plugins you can read the [Godot docs page](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/installing_plugins.html).

<!-- You can also install Dialogic using the **AssetLib** tab in the editor. !-->
